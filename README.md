# Your startup name here
I think I was told to modify this so here it is.
And this is an edit made from the website itself.

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever tried editing audio files? There are plenty of free applications available, but most of them limit your options behind a pay wall. But what if you want to edit an audio file without having to pay a ridiculous amount of money? Well, you came to the right place. This application gives you tools to edit audio files, letting you merge audio, change tempo, pitch, and more!


### Design

![Design image](StartupSpecDraft.jpg)

This is what the application will look like.

### Key features

- Upload audio files
- Modify audio files
> _trim,_
> _change speed,_
> _layer,_
> _denoise, etc_
- Store new audio files

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - At least two HTML pages, one for login and the other for the audio editor itself.
- **CSS** - Make it look pretty and easy to look at/navigate.
- **React** - Button to play/stop the audio, duplicate audio, sliders to trim, speed it up/slow it down, add more audio files, etc.
- **Service** - Stuff for login, modifying the audio soundwave itself, saving the modified audio into a new file, AI noise cleaning and other effects.
- **DB/Login** - Stores users and the new audio files they have created. Credentials securely stored. Can't find previously created audio files unless logged in.
- **WebSocket** - Add short audio clips from online, share audio with other users.

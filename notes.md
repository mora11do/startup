# Midterm 1 Note Dump










## Web Development Midterm Study Guide 1
Good luck on your midterm! Study smart, understand each concept deeply, and practice coding
examples — you’ve got this!

### In the following code, what does the link element do?
It links an external resource (usually a CSS file) to the HTML document. Example: `<link rel="stylesheet"`
href="styles.css"> applies styles from styles.css to the page.

### In the following code, what does a div tag do?
A `<div>`; is a block-level container that groups other elements. It's used for structure and layout.
Examples (use in layouts):
`<div class="header"> ... </div>`
`<div class="content"> ... </div>`
Divs have default display:block and take full width. They don't add behavior by themselves.

### In the following code, what is the difference between the #title and .grid selector?
#title selects an element by ID (unique). .grid selects elements by class (can apply to multiple elements).

### In the following code, what is the difference between padding and margin?
Padding: space inside the element (between content and border). Margin: space outside the element (between
border and other elements).

### Given this HTML and this CSS how will the images be displayed using flex?
If the container uses display: flex;, the images will be displayed in a row by default, side by side, unless
flex-direction: column; is specified.

### What does the following padding CSS do?
Example: padding: 10px 20px; adds 10px top/bottom and 20px left/right inside the element.

### What does the following code using arrow syntax function declaration do?
Arrow functions are a compact function syntax. (a, b) => a + b means a function with parameters a and b that
returns a+b.

Examples:
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const greet = name => `Hi ${name}`;
const square = x => { return x * x; } // block form
Note: arrow functions do not bind their own 'this' and are not suitable as constructors.

### What does the following code using map with an array output?
map() transforms every element of an array and returns a new array without mutating the original.
Examples:
const nums = [1,2,3];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2); // [2,4,6]
const names = ['Amy','Bob'];
const greetings = names.map(n => `Hi ${n}`); // ['Hi Amy','Hi Bob']

### What does the following code output using getElementByID and addEventListener?
Typical pattern:
const btn = document.getElementById('btn');
btn.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Clicked!'));
Behavior: When user clicks the element with id 'btn', the callback runs and prints 'Clicked!'.

### What does the following line of Javascript do using a # selector?
document.querySelector('#title') selects the first element that matches the CSS selector #title (element querySelector accepts any CSS selector (classes, attributes, pseudos).

### Which of the following are true? (mark all that are true about the DOM)
The DOM represents the HTML document as a tree of objects. You can use JavaScript to access and modify
DOM elements. Each HTML element is a node in the DOM.

### By default, the HTML span element has a default CSS display property value of:
inline

### How would you use CSS to change all the div elements to have a background color of red?
div { background-color: red; }

### How would you display an image with a hyperlink in HTML?
Wrap the &lt;img&gt; element with an &lt;a&gt; tag. Ensure the image file is in the correct folder (public or
images/) and the src path points to it.
`Example:`
`<a href="https://example.com">`
`<img src="images/logo.png" alt="Logo">`
`</a>`
Folder scheme example:
project/
index.html
images/
logo.png
css/
styles.css
If using a framework, the image may need to be in a 'public' or 'static' folder so it is served directly.

### In the CSS box model, what is the ordering of the box layers starting at the inside and working out?

Order: Content -> Padding -> Border -> Margin
Diagram:
+----------------+
| Margin |
| +------------+ |
| | Border | |
| | +--------+ | |
| | |Padding | | |
| | |Content | | |
| | +--------+ | |
| +------------+ |
+----------------+

Padding increases size inside border; margin creates space between elements.

### Given the following HTML, what CSS would you use to set the text "trouble" to green and leave the "double" text unaffected?
Given <p><span class="trouble">trouble</span> double</p>, use .trouble { color: green; }

### What will the following code output when executed using a for loop and console.log?
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { console.log(i); }
This initializes i=0, checks i<3 each loop, runs body and increments i++ after each iteration. Output

### How would you use JavaScript to select an element with the id of “byu” and change the text
color of that element to green?
Option 1 (direct):
document.getElementById('byu').style.color = 'green';
Option 2 (variable):
const byu = document.getElementById('byu');
byu.style.color = 'green';
Explanation: getElementById returns the DOM element. Assigning to variable avoids querying repeatedly.

### What is the opening HTML tag for a paragraph, ordered list, unordered list, second level
heading, first level heading, third level heading?
Paragraph: <p>, Ordered list: <ol>, Unordered list: <ul>, h2: <h2>, h1: <h1>, h3: <h3>

### How do you declare the document type to be html?
<!DOCTYPE html>

### What is valid javascript syntax for if, else, for, while, switch statements?
if (x > 5) { ... } else { ... } for (...) { ... } while (...) { ... } switch (x) { case 1: ...; break; default: ... }

### What is the correct syntax for creating a javascript object?
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };

### Is it possible to add new properties to javascript objects?
Yes. Example: person.city = "Provo";

### If you want to include JavaScript on an HTML page, which tag do you use?
<script src="script.js"></script>


### Given the following HTML, what JavaScript could you use to set the text "animal" to "crow" and
leave the "fish" text unaffected?
HTML:
<p id="animal">animal</p>
<p id="fish">fish</p>
Option 1 (direct):
document.getElementById('animal').textContent = 'crow';
Option 2 (variable):
const animal = document.getElementById('animal');
animal.textContent = 'crow';
Both work; second is clearer if reusing element.

### Which of the following correctly describes JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based format for structured data using key-value pairs. Example: {
"name": "John", "age": 25 }

### What does the console command chmod, pwd, cd, ls, vim, nano, mkdir, mv, rm, man, ssh, ps,
wget, sudo do?
chmod - change permissions, pwd - print working directory, cd - change directory, ls - list files, vim/nano - text
editors, mkdir - make directory, mv - move/rename, rm - remove, man - manual, ssh - remote shell, ps -
processes, wget - download files, sudo - run as admin

### Which of the following console command creates a remote shell session?
ssh
### Which of the following is true when the -la parameter is specified for the ls console command?
ls -la lists all files (including hidden) in long format

### Which of the following is true for the domain name banana.fruit.bozo.click, which is the top
level domain, which is a subdomain, which is a root domain?
TLD: .click, root domain: bozo.click, subdomain: fruit.bozo.click (and banana.fruit.bozo.click is a nested
subdomain)

### Is a web certificate is necessary to use HTTPS.
Yes, HTTPS requires a valid SSL/TLS certificate.

### Can a DNS A record can point to an IP address or another A record.
A DNS A record points to an IP address; it should not point to another A record.

### Port 443, 80, 22 is reserved for which protocol?
443 -> HTTPS, 80 -> HTTP, 22 -> SSH

### What will the following code using Promises output when executed?
Many possibilities depending on promise behavior. Examples:
1) Promise.resolve('Done').then(console.log) -> 'Done'
2) Promise.reject('Error').catch(console.error) -> 'Error'
3) new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res('Hi'),1000)).then(console.log) -> 'Hi' after 1s
4) Async function returns value -> printed when awaited or .then
5) Promise chain: Promise.resolve(2).then(x=>x*2).then(x=>x+1).then(console.log) -> 5
6) Reject handled -> shows error via catch.

## Deploying files to website
`./deployFiles.sh -k ~/.ssh/thekeypair.pem -h mora11do.click -s startup`

## CSS
Man who knows lol, just find other code that works and then use it and modify small things to make it work how you want.

## HTML
- Hyperlink: `<a href="https://www.example.com">How It Appears To Users</a>`
- Image : `<img src="https://example.com/horse.jpg" alt="Horse" width="500">`
- There are also body, p (paragraph), header, h1, nav, div, main, and other tags which I am still experimenting around with.

## Markdown
# first-level heading `#`
## second-level heading `## (up to 6 #)`
- `** bold` **bold**
- `_ italics` _italcs_
- `~~ strikethrough` ~~strikethrough~~
- `<sub> </sub>` <sub>subscript</sub>  
- `<sup> </sup>` <sup>superscript</sup>  
- `<ins> </ins>` <ins>underline</ins>
- `> quote` > quoted text
- backticks for quoting code like `this`
- triple backticks for quoting code like this:
```
This is in its own block
```

## Keypair
**USE __GIT BASH__, NOT POWERSHELL**
- Stored in `~/.ssh
> This is in a hidden directory
- **thekeypair.pem**
> You will need this to...access...something, I think


## GitHub Notes
- Commands
  - git pull #this will update VSCode to match what it looks like on GitHub
  - git add . #this will add changes to the queue, waiting to be pushed (BUT ONLY AFTER YOU ctrl+s in VSCode)
  - git commit -m ["insert message"] #this will...also add changes to the queue, I guess
  - git push #this will send the changes to GitHub
  - cry #this is not a command for the computer but it will be necessary in the future

## AWS

My IP address is: 54.81.96.130
Launching my AMI I initially put it on a private subnet. Even though it had a public IP address and the security group was right, I wasn't able to connect to it.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

This was easy. I was careful to use the correct structural elements such as header, footer, main, nav, and form. The links between the three views work great using the `a` element.

The part I didn't like was the duplication of the header and footer code. This is messy, but it will get cleaned up when I get to React.

## CSS

This took a couple hours to get it how I wanted. It was important to make it responsive and Bootstrap helped with that. It looks great on all kinds of screen sizes.

Bootstrap seems a bit like magic. It styles things nicely, but is very opinionated. You either do, or you do not. There doesn't seem to be much in between.

I did like the navbar it made it super easy to build a responsive header.

```html
      <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary">
        <div class="container-fluid">
          <a class="navbar-brand">
            <img src="logo.svg" width="30" height="30" class="d-inline-block align-top" alt="" />
            Calmer
          </a>
          <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent">
            <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
          </button>
          <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
            <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link active" href="play.html">Play</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="about.html">About</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Logout</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
```

I also used SVG to make the icon and logo for the app. This turned out to be a piece of cake.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#0066aa" rx="10" ry="10" />
  <text x="50%" y="50%" dominant-baseline="central" text-anchor="middle" font-size="72" font-family="Arial" fill="white">C</text>
</svg>
```

## React Part 1: Routing

Setting up Vite and React was pretty simple. I had a bit of trouble because of conflicting CSS. This isn't as straight forward as you would find with Svelte or Vue, but I made it work in the end. If there was a ton of CSS it would be a real problem. It sure was nice to have the code structured in a more usable way.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

This was a lot of fun to see it all come together. I had to keep remembering to use React state instead of just manipulating the DOM directly.

Handling the toggling of the checkboxes was particularly interesting.

```jsx
<div className="input-group sound-button-container">
  {calmSoundTypes.map((sound, index) => (
    <div key={index} className="form-check form-switch">
      <input
        className="form-check-input"
        type="checkbox"
        value={sound}
        id={sound}
        onChange={() => togglePlay(sound)}
        checked={selectedSounds.includes(sound)}
      ></input>
      <label className="form-check-label" htmlFor={sound}>
        {sound}
      </label>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```
